File Exclusions for SharePoint, SQL, OWA, IIS and Windows Server


Compiled a list of file exclusions based on a few different sources to have in one place.

SharePoint Server Exclusions
Note In the following sections, the placeholder Drive represents the letter of the drive on which you have your SharePoint application installed. Typically, this drive letter is C.

SharePoint Server 2016
You may have to configure your antivirus software to exclude the following folders and subfolders from antivirus scanning:

Drive:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions
If you do not want to exclude the whole Web Server Extensions folder from antivirus scanning, you can exclude only the following folders:

Drive:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\16
Drive:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\16\Logs
Drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Office Servers\16.0\Data\Office Server\Applications
Drive:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files
Drive:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config
Drive: \Users\ServiceAccount\AppData\Local\Temp\WebTempDir
Note: The WebTempDir folder is a replacement for the FrontPageTempDir folder.

Drive:\ProgramData\Microsoft\SharePoint
Drive:\Users\account that the search service is running as\AppData\Local\TempNote The search account creates a folder in the Gthrsvc_spsearch4 Temp folder to which it periodically must write.
Drive:\WINDOWS\System32\LogFiles
Drive:\Windows\Syswow64\LogFilesNote If you use a specific account for SharePoint services or application pools identities, you may also have to exclude the following folders:
Drive:\Users\ServiceAccount\AppData\Local\Temp
Drive:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Temp
You should also exclude all the virtual directory folders:

Drive:\inetpub\wwwroot\wss\VirtualDirectories and all the folders
Drive:\inetpub\temp\IIS Temporary Compressed Files.

SQL Server Exclusions
When you configure your antivirus software settings, make sure that you exclude the following files or directories (as applicable) from virus scanning. Doing this improves the performance of the files and helps make sure that the files are not locked when the SQL Server service must use them. However, if these files become infected, your antivirus software cannot detect the infection.

Note For more information about the default file locations for SQL Server, refer to the "File Locations for Default and Named Instances of SQL Server" topic for your specific version of SQL Server in SQL Server Books Online.

Files and Directory Exclusions

SQL Server data files
*.mdf
*.ldf
*.ndf
SQL Server backup files
*.bak
*.trn
Full-Text catalog files
Default instance: Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL\FTDATA
Named instance: Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL$instancename\FTDATA
Trace files
*.trc - these files can be generated either when you configure profiler tracing manually or when you enable C2 auditing for the server.
SQL audit files (for SQL Server 2008 or later versions)
*.sqlaudit
SQL query files
*.sql
The directory that holds Analysis Services data â€“ default is C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.X\OLAP\Data.  You can view and change the data directory by using Analysis Manager. To do this, follow these steps:

In Analysis Manager, right-click the server, and then click Properties.
In the Properties dialog box, click the General tab. The directory appears under Data folder.
The directory that holds Analysis Services temporary files that are used during Analysis Services processing â€“ default is C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.X\OLAP\Data. You can view and change the directory that holds temporary files in Analysis Manager. To do this, follow these steps:
In Analysis Manager, right-click the server, and then click Properties.
In the Properties dialog box, click the General tab.
On the General tab, notice the directory under Temporary file folder.
Note : Optionally, you can add a second temporary directory for Analysis Services 2000 by using the TempDirectory2 registry entry. If you use this registry entry, consider excluding from virus scanning the directory to which this registry entry points

Analysis Services backup files â€“ default is C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.X\OLAP\Backup
The directory that holds Analysis Services log files â€“ default is C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.X\OLAP\Log
Directories for any Analysis Services 2005 and later-version partitions that are not stored in the default data directory
Note When you create the partitions, these locations are defined in the Storage location section of the Processing and Storage Locations page of the Partition Wizard.
Filestream data files (SQL 2008 and later versions)
Remote Blob Storage files (SQL 2008 and later versions)
The directory that holds Reporting Services temporary files and Logs (RSTempFiles and LogFiles)

In IIS Manager, right-click the Web Sites folder, and then click Properties.
Click the Service tab.
Under HTTP Compression, make sure that Compress static files is selected, and then locate the path to the temporary directory.
